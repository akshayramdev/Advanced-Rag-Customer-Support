- Add comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Testing
Before submitting contributions:

```bash
# Test API functionality
python test_script.py

# Run evaluation suite
python simple_eval.py

# Verify all endpoints work
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Documentation
- Update README.md for any new features
- Add docstrings for new functions
- Include usage examples for new API endpoints

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **AdvancedRAGSystem**: Main system class managing all RAG operations
2. **QueryClassifier**: Intelligent query categorization
3. **GroqLLMClient**: LLM API integration with fallback mechanisms
4. **Vector Store**: FAISS-based similarity search
5. **Evaluation Framework**: Multi-dimensional quality assessment

### Key Design Principles
- **Explainability First**: Every decision should be explainable
- **Production Ready**: Code should handle edge cases and failures gracefully
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient caching and database operations
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns

## Areas for Enhancement

### High Impact Improvements
- **Multi-language Support**: Extend to support international customers
- **Advanced Conversation Management**: More sophisticated dialogue state tracking
- **Custom Model Integration**: Support for domain-specific fine-tuned models
- **Real-time Learning**: Continuous improvement from user feedback

### Performance Optimizations
- **Async Processing**: Convert blocking operations to async
- **Advanced Caching**: Redis integration for distributed caching
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA support for embedding generation
- **Database Optimization**: PostgreSQL migration for production scale

### Integration Capabilities
- **CRM Integration**: Salesforce, HubSpot connectors
- **Chat Platform APIs**: Slack, Teams, Discord integration
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications and updates
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, JWT token management

## Evaluation Standards

Any contributions should maintain or improve these metrics:
- Overall System Score: ≥85%
- Response Quality: ≥80%
- API Reliability: 100%
- Response Time: <5 seconds

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must include corresponding tests
- API changes require updated test_script.py coverage
- Performance improvements should be validated with simple_eval.py

## Submission Process

### Before Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Make your changes with appropriate tests
4. Run the full test suite to ensure nothing breaks
5. Update documentation as needed

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Provide clear description of changes
- Include performance impact analysis
- Add screenshots for UI changes
- Reference any related issues

### Code Review Process
- All submissions require review
- Focus on maintaining system reliability and explainability
- Performance regressions will require justification
- Documentation updates are expected for new features

## Performance Benchmarks

Current system performance (maintain or improve):

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Overall Score | 85.2% | ≥85% |
| Response Quality | 83.3% | ≥80% |
| Knowledge Base | 6,798 entries | Maintain scale |
| Response Time | <4 seconds | <5 seconds |
| API Uptime | 100% | 100% |

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- Response generation sometimes relies on fallback mechanisms
- Database queries could be further optimized for large datasets
- Error handling could provide more specific user feedback

### Future Architecture Improvements
- Microservices architecture for better scalability
- Event-driven design for real-time updates
- Container orchestration for production deployment

## Getting Help

### Development Questions
- Check existing documentation in README.md
- Review test implementations in test_script.py
- Examine evaluation methodology in simple_eval.py

### Performance Issues
- Run evaluation framework to identify bottlenecks
- Check system health via `/health` endpoint
- Monitor database query performance
